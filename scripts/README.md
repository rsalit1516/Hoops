# ID Generation and Automation Scripts

This directory contains automation scripts for generating unique IDs and creating agile documentation files with proper naming conventions and board integration.

## üìã Available Scripts

### Core ID Generation

- **`generate-epic-id.sh`** - Generate next available epic ID for a product area
- **`generate-story-id.sh`** - Generate next available story ID for epic area and type
- **`validate-ids.sh`** - Validate existing IDs and check for conflicts
- **`test-workflow.sh`** - Test the complete ID generation workflow

### File Creation (Template Integration)

- **`create-epic.sh`** - Create epic file from template with proper ID
- **`create-feature.sh`** - Create feature file from template with proper ID (NEW)
- **`create-story.sh`** - Create story file and BDD feature from templates

### Utility Scripts

- **`lib/registry-utils.sh`** - Shared utility functions for ID parsing and validation
- **`lib/update-epic-registry.sh`** - Update epic registry with new entries
- **`lib/update-story-registry.sh`** - Update story registry with new entries

## üöÄ Quick Start Examples

### Generate IDs Only

```bash
# Get next epic ID for Admin People Management
./scripts/generate-epic-id.sh APM
# Output: APM-002

# Get next feature ID
./scripts/generate-feature-id.sh APM "Director Management"
# Output: APMF-046

# Get next story ID for a feature
./scripts/generate-story-id.sh APM feature "Export people list"
# Output: APMF-004

# Get next bug fix ID
./scripts/generate-story-id.sh APM bug "Fix duplicate entries"
# Output: APMB-001
```

### Create Complete Files

```bash
# Create new epic with files and registry update
./scripts/create-epic.sh APM-045 "Admin People Management" "Tools for managing league people"

# Create new feature within an epic
./scripts/create-feature.sh APMF-046 "Director Management" APM-045 "Manage league directors"

# Create new story within a feature
./scripts/create-story.sh APMF-046 "View Directors List" APM-045
```

### Validation and Testing

```bash
# Validate all IDs and check for conflicts
./scripts/validate-ids.sh

# Test the complete workflow
./scripts/test-workflow.sh
```

## üîÑ Typical Workflow

### Creating a New Epic

1. Generate ID: `./scripts/generate-epic-id.sh APM "Admin People Management"`
2. Create files: `./scripts/create-epic.sh APM-045 "Admin People Management" "Tools for managing league people"`
3. Edit the generated epic file with business details
4. Create epic work item in Azure Boards
5. Update markdown file with Azure Boards work item ID

### Creating a New Feature

1. Determine parent epic: APM-045
2. Create feature: `./scripts/create-feature.sh APMF-046 "Director Management" APM-045 "Manage league directors"`
3. Edit the generated feature file with functional details
4. Create feature work item in Azure Boards
5. Update markdown file with Azure Boards work item ID
6. Link feature to parent epic in Azure Boards

### Creating a New Story

1. Generate ID: `./scripts/generate-story-id.sh APM feature "View Directors List"`
2. Create files: `./scripts/create-story.sh APMF-046 "View Directors List" APM-045`
3. Edit story file with acceptance criteria
4. Update BDD feature file with test scenarios
5. Create user story work item in Azure Boards
6. Update markdown file with Azure Boards work item ID
7. Link story to parent feature and epic in Azure Boards

### Board Integration

The generated IDs work seamlessly with:

**GitHub Issues:**

```
Title: [APLF-001] Add new player to system
Labels: story, epic:APL-001, points:5, priority:high
```

**Azure DevOps:**

```
Work Item Type: User Story
Title: [APLF-001] Add new player to system
Area Path: Hoops\Admin\Players
Tags: APL-001, player, admin
```

**Jira:**

```
Issue Type: Story
Summary: [APLF-001] Add new player to system
Epic Link: APL-001
Labels: player, admin, registration
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

- **Conflict Detection** - Scripts check for existing IDs before generating new ones
- **Registry Validation** - Ensures consistency between files and registry
- **Backup Creation** - Registry files are backed up before updates
- **Format Validation** - Validates ID formats and naming conventions
- **Sequence Management** - Automatically manages sequence numbers to prevent gaps

## üß™ Testing

Run the test suite to verify everything works:

```bash
./scripts/test-workflow.sh
```

This will test:

- ID generation for all product areas and story types
- File creation and template integration
- Registry updates and validation
- Error handling for invalid inputs
- Complete workflow validation

## üìñ Integration with Templates

All scripts integrate with the template system in `docs/templates/`:

- Epic files use `epic-template.md`
- Story files use `user-story-template.md`
- BDD features use `bdd-feature-template.feature`

Template placeholders are automatically replaced:

- `{{EPIC_ID}}` ‚Üí APL-001
- `{{STORY_ID}}` ‚Üí APLF-001
- `{{STORY_TITLE}}` ‚Üí "Add new player to system"
- `{{CURRENT_DATE}}` ‚Üí 2025-10-11

## üîß Customization

To add new product areas:

1. Edit `lib/registry-utils.sh`
2. Add to `PRODUCT_AREAS` array
3. Update documentation

To modify ID formats:

1. Edit validation patterns in `lib/registry-utils.sh`
2. Update generation functions
3. Run tests to verify changes
