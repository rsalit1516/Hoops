## Epic Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Administrators can efficiently search and filter people by multiple criteria
- [ ] People information can be viewed, added, edited, and deleted with proper validation
- [ ] Household relationships are clearly displayed and manageable
- [ ] All changes are audited with user metadata for accountability
- [ ] Interface is responsive and accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Performance supports datasets of 2000+ people with <2s load times

## Technical Architecture
### Components Affected
- `AdminPeopleList` - Main list view with filtering and pagination
- `PeopleFilter` - Search and filter controls
