# User Stories - User Management Cascading Dropdowns

## Epic: Enhanced User Management Interface

**As an administrator, I want an improved user management interface that allows me to efficiently create and manage users with proper household and person associations, so that I can maintain accurate user data relationships.**

---

## Story 1: Cascading Dropdown Implementation

**As an administrator**  
**I want to select a household first and then choose a person from that household**  
**So that I can properly link users to specific people in their households**

### Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] Household dropdown is populated with all available households on form load
- [ ] Household dropdown shows households in alphabetical order by name
- [ ] Person dropdown is initially disabled until a household is selected
- [ ] When a household is selected, person dropdown becomes enabled and populates with people from that household
- [ ] People are displayed as "LastName, FirstName" format
- [ ] People are sorted alphabetically by last name, then first name
- [ ] Changing households clears the person selection and repopulates the dropdown
- [ ] Clearing household selection disables and clears the person dropdown

### Definition of Done:

- [ ] Feature works in both create and edit modes
- [ ] Data persists correctly to database
- [ ] Unit tests cover all scenarios
- [ ] Integration tests verify end-to-end functionality
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] QA testing passed

**Story Points:** 8  
**Priority:** High  
**Dependencies:** PeopleService enhancement, Form validation updates

## Story 2: Form Layout and Field Ordering

**As an administrator**  
**I want the user form fields to be logically ordered and well-organized**  
**So that I can efficiently fill out user information in a natural workflow**

### Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] Fields appear in this specific order: User ID, Household, Person, Username, Name, User Type
- [ ] User ID field spans full width and is disabled
- [ ] Household and Person dropdowns are side-by-side on one row
- [ ] Username and Name fields are side-by-side on the row below dropdowns
- [ ] User Type field spans full width at bottom
- [ ] Form uses responsive 2-column grid layout
- [ ] Consistent spacing between form elements

### Definition of Done:

- [ ] Layout works on different screen sizes
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met
- [ ] Visual design approved by UX team
- [ ] Cross-browser testing completed

**Story Points:** 3  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Dependencies:** None

## Story 3: Dark Theme Dialog Styling

**As an administrator using the application in dark mode**  
**I want all dialog text and buttons to be clearly visible**  
**So that I can use the application comfortably in low-light environments**

### Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] All dialog text is white against dark background
- [ ] All button text is white
- [ ] Form field labels and borders are visible
- [ ] Sufficient contrast for accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Hover and focus states are clearly visible
- [ ] Error messages are legible

### Definition of Done:

- [ ] Accessibility audit passed
- [ ] Design system consistency maintained
- [ ] User testing completed
- [ ] Works across all supported browsers

**Story Points:** 2  
**Priority:** Low  
**Dependencies:** Design system updates

## Story 4: Data Persistence and Validation

**As an administrator**  
**I want user data to save correctly with household and person associations**  
**So that I can trust the system maintains accurate data relationships**

### Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] PeopleID field saves correctly to database when person is selected
- [ ] HouseID field saves correctly to database when household is selected
- [ ] Form pre-populates correctly when editing existing users
- [ ] Null values handled properly when no person is selected
- [ ] Database constraints prevent invalid foreign key references
- [ ] Success/error feedback provided to user

### Definition of Done:

- [ ] Database integrity maintained
- [ ] Error handling covers edge cases
- [ ] Performance testing completed
- [ ] Data migration scripts created if needed
- [ ] Monitoring and logging implemented

**Story Points:** 5  
**Priority:** High  
**Dependencies:** API updates, Database schema validation

---

## Story 5: API JSON Serialization Consistency

**As a system integrator**  
**I want consistent JSON property naming across all API endpoints**  
**So that frontend and backend communication is reliable and predictable**

### Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] All API endpoints return consistent JSON property names (camelCase)
- [ ] PersonId/PeopleID mapping works correctly in both directions
- [ ] Both main API and Functions API return identical JSON structure
- [ ] Deserialization handles case-insensitive property matching
- [ ] API documentation reflects actual endpoint behavior

### Definition of Done:

- [ ] API contract tests pass
- [ ] Swagger documentation updated
- [ ] Cross-environment testing completed
- [ ] Performance impact assessed
- [ ] Error handling tested

**Story Points:** 5  
**Priority:** High  
**Dependencies:** Backend serialization configuration

## Story 6: Comprehensive Test Coverage

**As a development team**  
**We want comprehensive test coverage for the cascading dropdown functionality**  
**So that we can confidently maintain and extend the feature**

### Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] Unit tests cover all component methods and edge cases
- [ ] Integration tests verify API communication
- [ ] E2E tests cover complete user workflows
- [ ] Performance tests ensure acceptable response times
- [ ] Accessibility tests validate WCAG compliance
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility tests pass

### Definition of Done:

- [ ] Test coverage > 90% for new code
- [ ] All tests pass in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Test documentation updated
- [ ] Test data setup automated
- [ ] Flaky tests identified and fixed

**Story Points:** 8  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Dependencies:** Test infrastructure updates
