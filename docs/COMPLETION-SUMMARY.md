# ✅ Documentation Reorganization Complete

**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Status:** Ready to use

## 🎯 What Was Accomplished

Successfully reorganized project documentation to follow the industry-standard **Epic → Feature → Story** hierarchy, removing planning/tracking sections that belong in Azure Boards.

## 📊 The New Hierarchy

```
Epic (Strategic - Months)
└── Feature (Tactical - Weeks)
    └── Story (Implementation - Days)
```

### Your Director Management Example

**CORRECT Structure:**

```
Epic: APM-045 - Admin People Management
└── Feature: APMF-046 - Director Management
    ├── Story: APMF-046 - View Directors List (5 pts)
    ├── Story: APMF-047 - Add New Director (3 pts)
    ├── Story: APMF-048 - Edit Director (3 pts)
    └── Story: APMF-049 - Delete Director (2 pts)
```

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Create Epic
./scripts/create-epic.sh APM-045 "Admin People Management" "Description"

# Create Feature
./scripts/create-feature.sh APMF-046 "Director Management" APM-045 "Description"

# Create Story
./scripts/create-story.sh APMF-046 "View Directors List" APM-045
```

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### When to Use Each Level

**Epic = Multiple Modules**

- Strategic business value

**Feature = Single Module (List + Forms)**

- Director Management (list, add, edit, delete)
- Takes weeks
- Complete functional capability

**Story = Single Operation**

- View Directors List
- Takes days
- Sprint-sized work

### Your Question Answered

**Q:** "List + Edit/Add forms - Epic or Feature?"
