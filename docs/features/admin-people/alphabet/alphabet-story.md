# Feature: Alphabet Navigation for Admin People Module

## Goal

Enable intuitive navigation through a large set of people records by providing clickable alphabet filters (Aâ€“Z). This improves user efficiency and reduces search overhead for admins managing league participants.

## Personas

- **Admin**: League organizer responsible for managing player and coach data.
- **Agent**: Automation assistant used to generate feature code and tests.

## User Stories

- As an Admin, I want to click on a letter to filter the People list by last name starting with that letter.
- As an Admin, I want a visual indication of the active filter.
- As an Admin, I want a way to clear or reset the filter.

## Assumptions

- People have last names stored and indexed.
- Alphabet filter is client-side and does not fetch new data unless paired with a search.
- State persistence (e.g., active letter) is stored via localStorage.

## Constraints

- Must not interfere with existing list filters (e.g., search bar, role type).
- Must be responsive and usable across device sizes.

## Acceptance Criteria
